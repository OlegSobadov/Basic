## Introduction

The Async Speech-to-Text Converter is a tool that allows users to convert speech to text in real-time. It utilizes the speech_recognition library to perform speech recognition on audio input from the microphone. The tool is designed to handle asynchronous tasks using asyncio, allowing for efficient and non-blocking processing of speech recognition.
It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with Start and Stop buttons to control the listening process.

## Features
- Real-time speech recognition: The tool continuously listens for voice commands and converts them to text in real-time.
- Asynchronous processing: The use of asyncio enables efficient handling of asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth and non-blocking operation.
- Graphical user interface (GUI): The tool provides a user-friendly GUI with Start and Stop buttons to control the listening process.
- Error handling and logging: Comprehensive error handling is implemented, with proper exception handling and logging of errors for easier debugging.
- User feedback: Clear and meaningful feedback is provided to the user during different stages of the speech recognition process, enhancing the user experience.
- Configuration options: Users can customize speech recognition options such as language, recognition model, and API credentials to suit their preferences and requirements.
- Performance optimization: The tool optimizes the speech recognition process by analyzing performance bottlenecks and implementing optimizations based on the analysis.
- Internationalization and localization: Support for multiple languages and localization of the user interface allows users from different regions to use the tool effectively.
- Accessibility: The tool meets accessibility standards by providing support for assistive technologies, keyboard navigation, and appropriate color contrast.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/OlegSobadov/async-speech-to-text.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the main.py file:

    ```shell
    python main.py

2. The graphical user interface (GUI) will open with two buttons: "Start Listening" and "Stop Listening".

3. Click the "Start Listening" button to start listening for voice commands. The application will continuously listen for voice commands and will convert your speech to text in real-time.

4. Click the "Stop Listening" button to stop listening for voice commands.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the application:

- Python (version 3.11 or higher)
- speech_recognition
- tkinter
